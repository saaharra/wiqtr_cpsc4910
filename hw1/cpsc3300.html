        <h1>CPSC3300 - FUNDAMENTALS OF DATABASES</h1>
        <p><font size = "4">This course will offer the student an introduction to the design and use of database systems. The objectives are to learn the fundamental 
            principles governing database management system design and operation.</font></p>

            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Some of the expected course outcomes are listed below</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use SQL proficiently (including triggers and stored procedures) to manipulate data
                </li>
                <p>
                    We learned that in order ensure that a database is following general constraints, you would achieve this by using triggers and assertions in SQL
                </p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Develop applications using databases 
                </li>
                <p>
                    With the use of this database, we were able to connect SQL to a sever and make a website application using PHP and HTML
                </p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create logical database models of varying complexity using a modeling tool
                </li>
                <p>
                    A data model is a collection of concepts and representations used to describe the structure of a complex real-world database.
