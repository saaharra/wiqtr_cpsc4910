        <h1>CPSC4100 - DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM</h1>
        <p><font size = "4">The main topics of this class is understand the design of algorithms using divide and conquer, greedy methods, and dynamic programming. 
            In addition to the analysis of algorithms, parallel algorithms, and intractability. </font></p>

            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Some of the expected course outcomes are listed below</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Evaluate the worst-case running time of an algorithm using big-O notation
                </li>
                <p>By learning how to Evaluate the worst-case scenarios, you can determine which algorithm is the best and wont have a long run-time</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use appropriate algorithms to solve fundamental graph-based problems 
                </li>
                <p>This will allow you to develop the skills to know what best algorithm that is needed to solve certain problems</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Explain what is meant by “best”, “average”, and “worst” case behavior of an algorithm.
                </li>
                <p>This will allow you to understand what the different types of steps taken by an algorithm that is needed for any possible input."></p>
            </ul>
