        <h1>CPSC3500- COMPUTING SYSTEMS</h1>
        <p><font size = "4">CPSC 3500 covers systems programming and introductory operating system design and implementation. We will cover the basics of operating systems, namely resource allocation, scheduling, concurrency, synchronization, virtualization, file systems, 
            networking, and security, as well as development of concurrent programs (multi-processing, multi-threading) and client-server networking programs.</font></p>

            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Some of the expected course outcomes are listed below</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Compare and contrast the common algorithms used in the scheduling of tasks in operating systems.
                </li>
                <p>
                    This would provide you with the knowledge of the different algorithms and the runtime of the scheduling for the operating system
                </p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Describe virtual memory and how it is implemented in hardware and software.
                </li>
                <p>
                    Virtual memory uses both hardware and software to enable a computer 
                    to compensate for physical memory shortages, temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage.
                </p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Describe the basic functionality for each layer of the network protocol stack.
                </li>
                <p>
                    This was where we had learned about the seven different layers that are apart of the Network Models
                </p>
