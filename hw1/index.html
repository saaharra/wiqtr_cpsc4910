            <h1>This is what I am planning on doing </h1>
            <p><font size = "4">While I am unsure of the exact direction I want to go in after I finish my degree, I think the thing at the top of my list is maybe
                becoming a front end developer or a web developer. I have always had an interest in this type of stuff since I was in high school and 
                it is a direction that I want to go in. If not that, I have the knowledge of different algorithms and object oriented design that would 
                provide me a good basis on going into backend and become a software engineer. I think the possibilities are endless and I can't wait to see
                what the future has for me. I think this degree will open a door of endless possibilities for me. </font>

                will check the how many different types of snacks the user has. If the user has more than 2 then they should just eat what they have else they have the right to 
                go off and order from that delivery place. If the place they want isn't opened then it checks how many snacks they have and depending on that, it tells the user
                what they should do with the snacks that they have.</font>
